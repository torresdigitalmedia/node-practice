This is the set up of grunt.  Although grunt has been added globally onto the PC with install -g grunt-cli, you still need to download it onto the project directory for each project.
You do this through the command " install grunt --save-dev"

this adds it to your project development dependencies.  Therefore it can check your project for you.  Very similar to browserify and watchify.
